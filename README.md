# BioStringCompress (BSC)
 Efficient compression of biological sequences for long term storage.

## TODO:
  - [] Update README
  - [] Write test scripts for BSC
  - [] Experiments for effectiveness of compression methods (use filesize as measurement)
    - [] Gene:
    - [] Sequence Alignment:
    - [] Long Read (NanoPore/MinION):
    - [] Genome:
  - [] Plot results of experiments
  - [] Write report/article
